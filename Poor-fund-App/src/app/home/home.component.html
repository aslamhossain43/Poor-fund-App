            The 'POOR FUND' was established by Md.Aslam Hossain in the 2019 to address the needs of a 
            growing number of people who need help.Today a group of organisers want to provide financial effort for
             those in our country who are in need of financial assistance.
        
            Funding for the assistance provided by the Poor Fund has no condition or back money. 
            Throughout the years, we have been able to provide this much needed assistance.
            
            The Poor Fund also coordinates its efforts with various community organizations in order to provide a more 
            comprehensive solution to the needs of our clients.
